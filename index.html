                The Lounge Chair, created by Charles and Ray Eames in the 1950s, was designed with the aim of combining an elegant appearance with ultimate comfort. It has been produced by Vitra using virtually the same methods ever since, and is now recognised as a great classic of twentieth-century furniture design. Offered in two sizes and various configurations with different types of leather upholstery covers, wooden shells and bases, the Lounge Chair is ideally complemented by the matching Ottoman.

                The small Lounge Chair Wood (LCW) is an iconic design by Charles and Ray Eames that dates from the period of their early experiments with three-dimensionally moulded plywood.

                Due to the slender organic shapes of its seat and back shells, the LCM (Lounge Chair Metal) by Charles and Ray Eames quickly acquired the nickname 'potato chip chair'.

                Today the Plastic Chairs by Charles and Ray Eames seem like archetypes of the genre of chairs whose shell can be combined with diverse bases. The combination of the wooden base with the plastic shell of the DAW (Dining Height Armchair Wood Base) produces a rich contrast of materials. The seat shells are also available with a seat cushion or full upholstery.

              <p>
                Charles and Ray Eames originally designed the Lobby Chairs to furnish lobby areas in New York City's Time & Life Building. Like all models of the Lobby Chair, the conference chair ES 108 has luxuriant leather-covered cushions that offer excellent comfort. The upholstery covers are available in different types of leather and in a wide range of colours.

              <p>
                For the Dining Height Side Chair Wood Base (DSW), Charles and Ray Eames combined the organically shaped seat shell with a four-legged wooden base. The pairing of plastic and wood gives the classic design a certain warmth and casual appeal. The seat shells can be fitted with seat cushions or full upholstery in a wide selection of fabric colours, enabling a multitude of individual configurations.
